### Project Overview

**Secure Configuration Management for .NET Applications**

This project is designed to enhance the security of .NET applications by providing a robust solution for managing configurations. Instead of relying on the traditional `appsettings.json` file, which can be prone to unauthorized access, this project stores configurations in a PostgreSQL database. The primary goal is to limit access to project configurations, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.

**Targeted towards developers and organizations** using in-house server farms to host .NET projects, this solution offers a more secure and manageable way to handle application settings, particularly in environments where security is paramount.

**Key Features:**
- **Easy Deployment:** The project is designed to be easily deployable using Docker, making it a flexible choice for various hosting environments.
- **Simple Configuration Management:** Managing configurations is straightforward, with a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and retrieving settings.
- **Type Checking:** Each configuration is type-checked upon creation, reducing the likelihood of errors and ensuring consistency across the application.

This project is ideal for teams looking to enhance their security posture while maintaining ease of use and flexibility in their .NET applications.
