# Project Roadmap: Configuration System for .NET Applications

## Step 1: Define Project Requirements
1. - [ ]  **Security**: Ensure that sensitive data is securely managed.
> Data that stored in persistent layer should encrypt before saving. This will add a more overhead on the operations, but this will not be a big problem.
2. - [ ]  **Flexibility**: Allow for different environments (development, staging, production).
> Multiple environment support is a necessary to succeed the project.
3. - [ ]  **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle large configurations efficiently.
4. - [ ]  **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing .NET Core/Framework applications.

## Step 3: Design the System
1. - [ ]  **Security**:
- Implement encryption for sensitive data.
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Step 4: Develop Configuration Fetching Logic
1. - [ ]  **Replace `appsettings.json`**:
- Create a custom configuration provider by implementing `IConfigurationProvider` and `IConfigurationSource`.
- Use the client library to fetch configurations from your service.
- Register your custom provider in the `Startup.cs`.

## Step 5: Implement Security Features
1. - [ ]  **Encryption**:
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing it.
- Decrypt data when fetching configurations.

## Step 6: Documentation
1. - [ ]  **API Documentation**:
- Document all API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI.
2. - [ ]  **Usage Guide**:
- Provide a guide on how to integrate the custom configuration provider into .NET applications.
3. - [ ]  **Security Guidelines**:
- Document how to securely manage configurations.

## Step 7: Deployment
1. - [ ]  **Containerization**:
- Containerize your API using Docker.
2. - [ ]  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
3. - [ ]  **Cloud Deployment**:
- Deploy your API and storage solution to a cloud platform (Azure, AWS, GCP).

## Step 8: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. - [ ]  **Monitoring**:
- Set up monitoring for your API using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Azure Monitor.
2. - [ ]  **Logging**:
- Implement logging to track errors and usage patterns.
3. - [ ]  **Regular Updates**:
- Keep dependencies updated.
- Regularly review and update security practices.

## Step 9: Community Engagement and Feedback
1. - [ ]  **Open Source**:
- Consider open-sourcing the project to get feedback and contributions.
2. - [ ]  **Feedback Loop**:
- Collect feedback from users and continuously improve the system.
