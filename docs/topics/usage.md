# Usage

#### Configuration Management

The %product% provides an intuitive user interface (UI) for managing your application’s settings. Through this UI, you can easily add, update, and retrieve projects and configurations.

##### Accessing the Configuration UI

Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can access the %product% UI via the following URL:

```
http://localhost:[PORT]
```

Replace `[PORT]` with the port number specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file (e.g., `7206`).
